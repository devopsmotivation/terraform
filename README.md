Terraform
------------------
# Terraform

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables you to define and manage infrastructure using code. With Terraform, you can provision and manage resources across different cloud platforms, enabling cloud-agnostic infrastructure management.

## Features

Terraform provides several key features that make it a powerful tool for managing infrastructure:

### Multi-Cloud Provisioning

Terraform supports various cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more. This enables you to provision and manage resources across different cloud platforms, making it easy to manage multi-cloud environments.

### Automation and Orchestration

Terraform automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure, making it easy to deploy and manage complex setups. It also facilitates orchestration, enabling you to manage the entire lifecycle of your infrastructure.

### Modularity and Reusability

Terraform configurations can be modularized, making it easy to reuse code and simplify maintenance and development. This promotes code reusability and simplifies the process of managing infrastructure.

### State Management

Terraform maintains a state file to track the current state of infrastructure. This enables efficient and accurate updates by understanding existing resources, making it easy to manage infrastructure changes over time.

# Real world example where terraform is useful 

Provisioning hundreds of resources across multiple cloud platforms can be a complex and time-consuming process. Terraform simplifies this process by enabling you to define and manage infrastructure using code. This makes it easy to provision and manage resources across different cloud platforms, enabling cloud-agnostic infrastructure management.

 Terraform is also useful for managing infrastructure across different environments, such as development, staging, and production.
